So let's make it simple</strong>, after creating your adventurer's profile in two clicks, you can tell us about your first trip without further ado.<br> <br><strong>1 page = 1 adventure</strong>, a little name to attract the attention of the onlookers, a picture to show us and a description to make your pen speak. From here you can publish the page and share it with your friends and family to tease your trip.<br> <br>Once you're on the road, you'll have the opportunity to enhance this adventure <strong>with stages</strong>... <em>\"A stage? But what does a stage mean?\"</em> Well, that's up to you, for some people a stage will be a day on the road, for others a point of arrival, in short it's up to you.<br> <br>To create a stage, you will have to define a starting point and an arrival point, if you had programmed your GPS, then why not also import the <code>.gpx</code> ? Then a small description of the walk and some photos to embellish the whole and make us want to follow your track.<br><br><strong>And here it is! simple... efficient...</strong>"
